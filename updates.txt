These updates aim to fix minor errors in the original RBHP charts, such as words being displayed twice and what should be individual notes being split up into several.

It is recommended that you play these harmonies using scrolling vocals, as there are particularly strange bugs existing in static vocals that for the life of me I cannot figure how to fix at this point in time. The main bugs in question are harmony phrases being vastly spaced out between each other (a notable example of this would be the start of One Way or Another, or Peace Sells), and some lyrics straight up not displaying (a notable example of this would be E-Pro). If you can figure out how to fix these bugs, please let me know, because I would love to fix all the harmonies that contain these bugs.

With that in mind, below are the updates I was able to implement in the release version of RBHP:

UPDATES:

Rock Band 2:
